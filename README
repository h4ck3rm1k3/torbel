TorBEL (or whatever it's called) is a server that attempts to answer
one thing and one thing only for its clients:

Does this traffic originate from the Tor network?

TorBEL continuously maintains a database of currently running exit
nodes and their exit policies.  It allows clients to query for any
valid IP address and port combination and will return whether or not
this combination represents a recently active Tor exit node.

TorBEL also continuously connects to these exit nodes to ensure that
traffic is able to exit from the node and that traffic indeed exits
from the IP address advertised by the node.
