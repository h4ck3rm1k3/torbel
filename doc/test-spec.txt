0. Scope

  This document describes the mechanism by which TorBEL performs
  active testing on exit routers on the Tor network.

  This document is a work-in-progress and the active testing mechanism
  may change quickly during the summer in response to demand and
  implementation issues.

1. Active Testing

  TorBEL actively tests exit routers for consistency and common
  configuration issues by opening a circuit to each exit router under
  test.  TorBEL then attempts to open a TCP connection to itself on
  each port of interest and write a short sequence of data.  If the
  connection is successful and the data arrives unchanged, that port
  is recorded as Working.  If the connection is refused or filtered,
  that port is recorded as Failed.

  The sequence of data sent used for each port test is unique, and
  used to ensure the results are not tampered with. TorBEL will not
  test a port that is explicitly rejected by the ExitPolicy of the
  router.

1.1. Privileged Ports
  
  Active testing is performed to verify exits from the following
  common privileged ports:
    - 21  (ftp)
    - 22  (ssh)
    - 23  (telnet)
    - 25  (smtp)
    - 43  (whois)
    - 53  (domain)
    - 80  (http)
    - 88  (kerberos)
    - 110 (pop3)
    - 115 (sftp)
    - 123 (ntp)
    - 143 (imap)
    - 443 (https)
    - 706 (silc)
    - 993 (imaps)
    - 995 (pop3s)

1.2. Unprivileged Ports

  Active testing is performed to verify exits from the following common
  privileged ports:
    - 5190 (aol)
    - 6667 (irc)
    - 8080 (http-alt)
    - 8443 (https-alt)

1.3. ExitAddress Testing

  The IP address advertised by a router may not be the actual IP
  address from which traffic exits to the Internet.  This is due to a
  number of factors, not all of which are malicious, including:

    - The router may exit traffic through a different interface or
      IP address than the address used for connections from other
      Tor routers.

    - iptables or equivalent host-based firewall rules may have
      traffic for certain ports exit from different IP addresses.
      Thus the IP address seen for an exit router using port 80 might
      not be the same as when using port 6667.
      
    - The router may be behind a NAT device that has a pool of IP
      addresses for outgoing traffic.  While the router may be able to
      accept incoming traffic at a fixed address and ORPort, each
      connection coming out of the exit router may then have a
      different external IP address.

  TorBEL attempts to determine the first case in a simple
  manner. While testing a port, TorBEL will simply call getpeername()
  to find the IP address of the connected peer, assuming it receives
  the traffic sequence it is expecting.

  The second case is more difficult, since TorBEL does not and should
  not test all possible ports allowed through a router's ExitPolicy.
  Thus it is possible that TorBEL will not find out all IP addresses
  associated with a particular exit; however, if more than one IP
  address is discovered through active testing, each will be recorded
  in a separate record as in data-spec.

  Another interesting issue is that operators may run several exit
  routers on the same IP address, possibly with separate exit
  policies.  Each of these routers will have the same IP address but
  separate identity key hashes.  In this case, each router instance
  will have its own record with unique identity keys but non-unique IP
  addresses.
