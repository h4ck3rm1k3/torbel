About TorBEL
============

TorBEL is a server that attempts to answer one thing and one thing
only for its clients:

  Does this traffic originate from the Tor network?

TorBEL continuously maintains a database of currently running exit
nodes and their exit policies.  It allows clients to query for any
valid IP address and port combination and will return whether or not
this combination represents a recently active Tor exit node.

TorBEL also continuously connects to these exit nodes to ensure that
traffic is able to exit from the node and that traffic indeed exits
from the IP address advertised by the node.

Software Requirements
=====================

The following are required to run TorBEL on your system:

 - Tor 0.2.2.13-alpha or higher recommended, with an open
   control port.
 - Python (>= 2.5 is recommended) 
 - Recent Git version of TorCtl
 - SocksiPy 

Network Requirements
====================

TorBEL's controller tests a number of ports by connecting back to
itself over the Tor network.  It is recommended to run the TorBEL
controller on a DMZ interface where any and all traffic can reach
it, otherwise active testing may be incomplete.

It is recommended to not use the Tor instance controlled by TorBEL
for normal network traffic, to maximize performance and reliability.
