TorBEL is based on torflow, a set of Python libraries and scripts
developed by Mike Perry and Nick Matthewson of the Tor project.

Debugging
=========

In config.py, the following options are quite useful for debugging:

  - torctl_debug = True
    This will instruct TorCtl to dump its communications with the running
    Tor instance to file.  This is useful if you believe the problem lies
    with TorCtl or that TorBEL is not considering information that should
    be available in TorCtl.
    
  - log_level = DEBUG
    This is an appropriate log level for most development purposes.
    VERBOSE1 and VERBOSE2 are much more noisy and should only be used
    if you suspect something rather strange going on in TorBEL.

  - torctl_log_level = INFO or NOTICE
    Only increase the TorCtl log verbosity to DEBUG if you suspect
    something wrong in TorCtl or with TorBEL's handling of TorCtl
    errors.

Disabling Active Testing
========================

To run TorBEL simply as a glorified ConsensusTracker, run torbel with the
"notests" option:

  $ ./main.py notests

This is useful to verify its handling of NEWCONSENSUS or to track down
non-testing-related bugs.
